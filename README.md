Code and plots for 'coastal and estuarine flooding' and 'coastal erosion and shoreline change' NCRA hazards

## Description
GitHub repository for ACS Coastal Hazard Team to store, track and develop code. 

## Indices considered by the hazard team:
- Mean Sea Level (Essential Climate Variable)
- Flood days
- Flood extent of 1% AEP
- Change in frequency (multiplication factor) of storm tide levels (MF-ST)
- Change in frequency (multiplication factor) of total water levels (MF-TW)

## Products:
Status of the NCRA deliverables. 
Global Warming Levels are unsuitable for understanding sea-level rise (SLR)-related hazards due to SLR continuing long after temperatures stabilise. 
We selected several SLR increments (SLRI) relative to the IPCC AR6 baseline of 1995 – 2014 for the National Climate Risk Assessment as follows:
- 0.06 m: Approximately 2010-2029 mean, the "present-day" period used in NCRA)
- 0.2 m: Approximate projected SLR at 2030
- 0.38 m: Approximate projected SLR GWL 2.0, assuming GWL 3.0 is reached in 2090.
- 0.6 m: Approximate projected SLR at GWL 3.0, assuming GWL 3.0 is reached in 2090.
- 1.0 m: Higher-end projected SLR consistent with jurisdictional planning benchmarks used in Australia (c.f., Dedekorkut-Howes et al. 2021, DOI: 10.1080/14693062.2020.1819766)

MME = multi-model ensemble
